GIVE WITH MEANING
For over 110 years, as the floral-gifting experts, we’ve been helping you give with more care, with greater ease, and with more meaning.<br>
            
Established in 1910 as a collective of 10 florists, Florists’ Transworld Delivery (FTD) used the telegraph to transform the age-old practice of flower-giving. We understood then the unique power of flowers to express a sentiment and helped people across the world “Say it with flowers.” Today, we have grown into an extensive network made up of thousands of local florists — each one an artisan who is handcrafting and hand-delivering fine bouquets all across the country.

When you’re giving with FTD you’re giving the gift of joy, strength, and love and you're giving it with meaning.
