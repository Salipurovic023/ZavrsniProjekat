            <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">Established in 1910 as a collective of 10 florists, Florists` Transworld Delivery (FTD) used the telegraph to transform the age-old practice of flower-giving. We understood then the <br>
                 unique power of flowers to express a sentiment and helped people across the world “Say it with flowers.” Today, we have grown into an extensive network made up of thousands of<br>
                  local florists — each one an artisan who is handcrafting and hand-delivering fine bouquets all across the country.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">When you`re giving with FTD you`re giving the gift of joy, strength, and love and you're giving it with meaning.</p><br>
